\chapter*{Executive Summary}

The goal of this report is to provide a summary of the work I completed and the experiences I had while working as an intern at Kaz Software, one of Bangladesh's most experienced software company.
This report will go over the specifics of my six-month software engineering internship at Kaz Software, which lasted from September 1st, 2021, to February 28th, 2022.\\


Prior to graduating, students who are studying software engineering at IICT, SUST, must complete a six-month internship program.
As long as the company is reputable, students are free to choose where they will complete their internships, although in most cases, teachers at IIC, SUST will submit their students' resumes to potential employers, who will then select interns from among them.
This is to ensure that the students will have the opportunity to work in an industrial setting.
The purpose of an internship is to expose students to the realities of the workplace, help them comprehend their course material more thoroughly, and offer them the necessary work-related training for the field of software engineering.
