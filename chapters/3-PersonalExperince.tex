\chapter{Personal Experience}

From interview to the end of my internship and beyond, I passed a great time at Kaz Software.
In this chapter, I'll go through those experiences.

\section{Interview}

I had a phone interview with Shawal Siddique (CTO, Kaz Software).
It was not a formal interview.
He called and asked me questions about in what technology I worked on, questions about ReactJS, how I like my work environment etc.
He confirmed my internship in that call.

\section{Team Artisan}

As an intern, I joined the Team Artisan in Kaz Software.
It is a team with some talented and friendly members.
I worked for six months as an intern in that team, and joined as an Associate Software Engineer later.

\subsection{Members}

Team Artisan consists of some great members, who are talented, friendly and helpful at the same time.
Current members of Team Artisan are:

\subsection{Office Hours}

Kaz has different office hours for different teams.
Team can choose office hours according to their ease.
But each team should work for 8 hours, 5 days a week with one hour of lunch break at 2:00 PM.
Team Artisan starts working at 11:00 AM and ends at 7:00 PM.

\subsection{Scrum}

Each working day at 11:00 AM, all of the members of Team Artisan have a scrum meeting.
Every member must join the meeting unless they are on leave.
In this scrum meeting members discuss:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What did they do the last day
    \item What will they work on today
    \item Issues and blockers they are facing
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{CTO Meeting}

On Tuesday 3:00 PM of every first full week of a month the members of Team Artisan have a meeting with the CTO.
In this meeting they discuss about the progress of the projects the team currently working on, the wellbeing of the member and the members' real life events.
Every member of the team must join this meeting.

\subsection{Fine Driven Development}

FDD is a fun terminology, but it is strictly followed in Team Artisan.
There is a fine if a member misses the scrum meeting or CTO meeting.
There is fine for committing code with silly mistake or deploy a buggy code to the production.
And there is a rule book for the team, and if a member break any rule, s/he might get a fine.
There is also a fee for a Kazian when s/he joins or leave the team.
The fine amount is small and the fund created from these fines are used for recreation of the team, like a party or a tour.
