\chapter{Introduction}

An internship is a professional learning experience that offers meaningful, practical work related to a studentâ€™s field of study or career interest.
An internship gives a student the opportunity for career exploration and development, and to learn new skills.
It offers the employer the opportunity to bring new ideas and energy into the workplace, develop talent and potentially build a pipeline for future full-time employees.
Internships are usually offered part-time if it is during a university semester, or full-time if it is during a vacation.
And in most of the cases, the internship is paid. \\
