\section{Electronic Visit Verification}

It was the first project I worked on and spend most of my time on as an intern in Kaz Software.
It has both Mobile and Web application.
I worked on the web application, on front-end.
The design team in Kaz Software made the mock design of the application and I with my teammates brought the design to live.

\subsection{Project Overview}

Due to the 21st Century Cures Act, all care visits provided in the home must be verified electronically â€” no more pen and paper.
Each state has unique requirements for electronic visit verification which can cause stress and confusion for providers.
This application implement a solution to help the agencies operate more efficiently and advocate for beneficiaries, all while keeping their staff safe. \\

This application offers the most efficient scheduling and EVV capabilities on the market, saving coordinators time, eliminating errors, and making it easy for caregivers to clock in and out.
Using this web-based solution, one can enable more effective workflows across an entire agency environment and automate time-consuming manual tasks.

\subsection{My Involvement}

From the first day of my internship I started working in this application.
At first I started working with Ibrahim Bhai and Masum Bhai on the front end using ReactJS and Typescript.
They gave me an overview of the application in the first week and gave me mock design of the application.
And I started working right away.\\

There are two user classes in the front-end web application.
One is for Company admin, another is for Super Admin.
There is one more user class for the mobile application for Caregivers.
In total there were almost 50 pages in the web application and I either designed, implemented, refactored, updated or reviewed each one of them.\\

Later both Ibrahim Bhai and Masum Bhai stopped working on the front-end, I started working with Abdullah-Al Jahid and Siana Rizwan, two interns from Dhaka University and Islamic University of Technology respectively.
And during the whole time Pandey Bhai along with Tulshi Bhai, Ibrahim Bhai, Souhardya, developed the backend of the application and Abdullah-Al Foysal developed the mobile application.

Here are some screenshots of the pages I designed:
