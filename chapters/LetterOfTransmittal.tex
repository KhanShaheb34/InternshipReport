Dear Sir,\\
I am very much delighted to submit a report as a part of my internship program.
I am so thankful to the Institute of Information and Communication Technology, SUST for giving me the opportunity to connect my academic knowledge with the latest software development trends in a renowned software industry and to gather great industry experience.\\
I have been working as an intern at Kaz Software as a part of our course SWE 420, starting from September 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022.
This report is based on my learning and experience during my internship time period. And this report covers the technical skills I developed during my internship program as well as my project participation, skill acquisition, and other improvements and issues.\\
I believe this report will be able to summarize the overall outcome of my internship course.
